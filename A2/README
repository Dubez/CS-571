This is where you maybe (quickly) outline the project, the files you've
submitted (what they do), how to compile and run (which should, largely, be
taken care of by your makefile).  But, there might be notes, like, "remember
that ARCHIVE needs to be defined in the environment".

This is also where you'd tell me anything you want to say before your
assignment is graded, so we know what to look for, that we might give you
points for, and you're not wasting our time.

With all the files (README, expected.out, foo.c, foo.h, foo.java, foo.py, main.c)
in the A2 folder a lot of make commands are necessary to be able to fully answer
the questions in the assignment.

i. The target recreation steps were shuffled a bit in order to get 'make' to act 
recursively.

ii. The '>' operator was used to send the foo.java output into the test.out file for
comparison with the expected.out file.

iii. To save the TA's the stres of having to hit the 'make' command multiple times,
I incorporated a bash script (a2.sh) in the same folder as the files needed for the
assignment. Each line of this bash script has a brief comment explaining what the 
corresponding command achieves.
This bash file has all permissions activated for all users. From the terminal, run thus:

		$bash a2.sh

iv. The comparison shows that the test.out and expected.out files contain the same thing.

v. The bash script goes ahead to clean all temporary/unncessary files before exiting.
