README file to explain how to use the awk scripts to answer the questions.
The file containing the scores dataset is called 'scores' and is supplied with
the other scripts.

1. To answer the first question, run as below. It checks the score dataset per
row to be sure all the rows have the same number of fields.
	$awk -f q1.awk scores

2. To answer the second question, run as below. It prints the name of any
student with a 0.
	$awk -f q2.awk scores 

3. To answer the third question, run as below. It uses the bash script to
first sort the rows by the final test score and then print out the student
with the highest score.
	$bash q3.sh < scores | awk -f q3.awk

4. To answer the fourth question, run as below. It prints the average score of
each student, as well as the average score of the whole class.
	$awk -f q4.awk scores

5. To answer the fifth question, run as below. Two awk scripts are used to
achieve this - one to sort and another to find the middle score.
	$awk -f q5a.awk scores | awk -f q5b.awk

6. To answer the sixth question, run as below. It converts the average scores
into letter grades.
	$awk -f q6.awk scores

7. To answer the seventh question, run as below. It takes the result of q6.awk
as input and then counts the number of students with each grade.
	$awk -f q6.awk scores | awk -f q7.awk

8. To answer the eighth question, run as below. Like q7.awk, it takes the
result of q6.awk as input and then counts the number of students with each
grade, using the '*' as a histogram.
	$awk -f q6.awk scores | awk -f q8.awk
