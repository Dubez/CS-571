This README file provides information relevant to working with the python scripts to answer the questions.

1. q1.py is used to compute the average score for each student. It is used thus:
	$ python q1.py students

2. q2.py is used in a similar way to q1 above to compute the average score for each student. It is used thus:
	$ python q2.py students.csv

3. q3.py is used to sort the entries in the ids file in ascending order of ID. It is used thus:
	$ python q3.py ids

4. q4.py is a modification of q3.py. It counts the command-line arguments, lookinf for a file to read and sort, but, unlike q3.py, if no filename is supplied, it defaults reads entries from standard input. It can then be used in two ways:
	$ python q4.py	<filename>
		OR:
	$ python q4.py
In the second case, it will ask user for entries through standard input (keyboard). User uses Ctrl-D to complete manual entry.

5. parsePhoneNrs2.py is used to parse through a file containing phone numbers. It displays phone number extensions for valid entries, the extensions could be between 1 and 4 digits (exclusing the 'x' indicator). It is used thus:
	$ python parsePhoneNrs2.py <filename>

6. The help option has been added to give a brief description of how the script works and how to use it. The help information can be viewed in two ways:
	$ python parsePhoneNrs2.py -h
		OR:
	$ python parsePhoneNrs2.py --help
